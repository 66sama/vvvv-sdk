Instructions to build structure synth node.

Note: you need visual studio c++ 2005 to build it.
(My version is professional, not tested with another one).

1/Download Qt open source edition:
http://trolltech.com/downloads

2/Build Qt:
Unzip qt in any folder (will say C:\qt4.4 for the example).

Open visual studio 2005 command prompt (so it load the necessary environment variables).

go to C:\qt4.4 from this.

type: configure (this usually take 20-30 minutes)
then type: nmake (this will take a few hours).


You then need to create an environment variable named: 
QT4DIR
which points to:
C:\qt4.4

You now can open the project and build it.

NOTE: you eed to build it on release to use it on a machine without visual c++ installed (otherwise you have to 
install a lot of different libraries).
