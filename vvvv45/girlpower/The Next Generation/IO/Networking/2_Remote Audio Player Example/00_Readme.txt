This is an example on how to communicate.

vvvv is talking via OSC to:

- ableton live (using max for live)
- max/msp
- pure data
- vvvv

Please start the 01_control-osc-vvvv.v4p to have the controls over the different players.
These players can be placed on different machines, you just need to update the IP-address and the port number.
