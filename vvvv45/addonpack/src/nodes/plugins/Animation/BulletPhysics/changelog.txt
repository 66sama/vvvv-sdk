13/01/2011:
-Custom string output from rigid body was not working
-Fixed SpreadMax bug on ConvexHull Rigid Shape
-Added custom string for Rigid Shapes
-Added GetRigidShapeDetails to get shape custom
-Now Any objects can have an extra custom object (Must Implement ICloneable)
-Added Allow Sleep/Is Active in CreateBody
-Added Is Static/Kinematic/ContactResponse in CreateBody
-Fixed Reset world for persistent body creator
-Added World Reset as event in datatype, so world subnodes can be notified asap


15/01/2011:
-GetContactPoint new node.
-Fixed couple of kinematic issues.
-Some objects were not disposed properly.
-Scaling for Box/Sphere to reflect vvvv standard meshes, with default values updated
-First constraint, single object point to point.
-DestroyConstraint.

16/01/2011:
-ApplyForce/Torque/Impulse have autoactivate option
-RayCast outputs body, query index
-UpdateBody Have Position/SetPosition (Only use with kinematic)
-HeightField is now scaled/centered correctly

31/01/2011:
-Set rotation in UpdateRigidBody
-Kinematic/Static bodies set shape mass automatically to 0.
-Set size values as absolute to avoid negative size objects (thanks West)
-Sphere/Cylinder Resolution
