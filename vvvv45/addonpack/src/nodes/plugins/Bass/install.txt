Bass Plugin for vvvv (alpha 0.2)

NOTE: This is a development version. This is not intended for any production use.
-Some values are still hard coded (AudioIn)
-Some pins names might change

To Install the plugin in vvvv:

-Copy the files: 
Dependencies\bass_fx.dll
Dependencies\bass.dll

Into the vvvv Bin folder

-Copy the files:

Dependencies\Bass.Net.dll

And the two compiled files:
AsioBassSound.dll
BassSound.dll

Into the plugins folder

If you don't have an asio sound card, you can download a generic driver (asio4all) here:
